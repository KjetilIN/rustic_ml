## M1 - Implement fundamental building blocks and learn!

In this phase the knowledge of Machine Learning and Rust is low. Therefor learning is a big part of this phase. One of the goals is to build the machine learning library from scratch, which is why this step is also used to build these fundamental tools.

- [x] `Matrix` implementation ([#6](https://github.com/KjetilIN/rustic_ml/issues/6))
- [ ] `Dataframe` implementation ([#21](https://github.com/KjetilIN/rustic_ml/issues/21))
- [ ] `Perceptron` implementation ([#32](https://github.com/KjetilIN/rustic_ml/issues/32))
  - [ ] Add example of usage in ./examples/
- [ ] Linear regression model 
    - [ ] Add example of usage in `./examples/`


## M2 - Deep learning phase (v0.1.0 released)
The fundamental parts of ML should be implemented. Now, further progress will be focused on learning about neural networks. 

- [ ] Read `Make Your Own Neural Network` by Tariq Rashid 
    - [ ] Supply with `CS299 Lecture notes on Deep Learning`
    - [ ] Supply with `Machine Learning Yearning` by Andrew Ng during development
- [ ] Neural Network implemented (as simple as possible, not optimized)
